round.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":16.9,"externalId":"401437962","id":"01401437962","proTeamId":25,"scoringPeriodId":18,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":10.0,"24":45.0,"27":9.0,"28":4.0,"29":2.0,"30":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"39":4.5,"40":45.0,"41":3.0,"42":34.0,"43":1.0,"47":6.0,"48":3.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":3.0,"58":3.0,"59":36.0,"60":11.333,"61":34.0,"155":1.0,"158":6.0,"185":1.0,"210":1.0,"212":3.0,"213":2.0}},{"appliedTotal":31.3,"externalId":"401437943","id":"01401437943","proTeamId":25,"scoringPeriodId":17,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":19.0,"24":121.0,"25":1.0,"27":24.0,"28":12.0,"29":6.0,"30":4.0,"31":2.0,"32":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"37":1.0,"39":6.368,"40":121.0,"41":6.0,"42":72.0,"47":14.0,"48":7.0,"49":3.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":6.0,"54":1.0,"58":9.0,"59":71.0,"60":12.0,"61":72.0,"155":1.0,"158":6.0,"180":1.0,"210":1.0,"212":6.0,"213":3.0}},{"appliedAverage":19.23192171842857,"appliedTotal":269.246904058,"externalId":"2023","id":"102023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":187.9833034,"24":855.5308356,"25":6.553834139,"26":0.238470526,"27":171.0,"28":85.0,"29":42.0,"30":34.0,"31":17.0,"33":37.0,"34":18.0,"35":0.380271598,"36":0.266190118,"37":1.904368708,"38":0.064988798,"39":4.551100125,"40":60.34864816,"42":554.9390405,"43":3.306288884,"44":0.197222039,"45":0.071032027,"46":0.04641943,"47":110.0,"48":55.0,"49":27.0,"50":22.0,"51":11.0,"53":69.74525604,"54":13.0,"55":6.0,"56":0.511381297,"57":0.015815916,"58":87.10819831,"60":7.956656437,"61":39.14507754,"62":0.435692565,"63":0.007323697,"66":1.21404403,"67":0.450432619,"68":1.664476649,"70":0.558460254,"71":0.252242267,"72":0.810702521,"73":0.810702521,"210":14.17647059,"212":47.26574281,"213":31.40256886}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2023","id":"002023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":20.962352941176473,"appliedTotal":356.36,"externalId":"2022","id":"002022","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":1.0,"1":1.0,"3":34.0,"4":1.0,"5":6.0,"6":3.0,"7":1.0,"8":1.0,"21":1.0,"22":2.0,"23":244.0,"24":1139.0,"25":8.0,"27":219.0,"28":104.0,"29":48.0,"30":37.0,"31":14.0,"32":5.0,"33":42.0,"34":16.0,"37":5.0,"39":4.66803279,"40":67.0,"41":85.0,"42":741.0,"43":5.0,"47":141.0,"48":67.0,"49":29.0,"50":22.0,"51":7.0,"53":85.0,"54":8.0,"58":108.0,"59":695.0,"60":8.71764706,"61":43.58823529,"66":1.0,"68":1.0,"155":11.0,"156":6.0,"158":84.0,"178":1.0,"179":5.0,"180":2.0,"182":1.0,"183":2.0,"184":1.0,"185":2.0,"210":17.0,"211":1.0,"212":59.0,"213":36.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":2,"totalRanking":6,"totalRating":356.36}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1690700400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":4362628,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":58,"published":false,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":57,"published":false,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":false,"eligibleSlots":[3,4,5,23,7,20,21],"firstName":"Ja'Marr","fullName":"Ja'Marr

is entering his third NFL season following a 2022 campaign in which he missed five games, but he saw a big uptick in usage (24% to 29% target share) and fantasy production (17.9 to 20.2 fantasy PPG) compared to his rookie campaign. The 2021 first-round pick has finished top 5 among WRs in touchdowns, end zone targets and fantasy PPG in both of his professional seasons. The Bengals called the league's second-pass heaviest offense last season, and Chase has separated himself from Tee Higgins as Joe Burrow's clear No. 1 target.

Kelce set new career-best marks in targets, receptions and TDs and has now finished no lower than second among TEs in catches, yards and fantasy points each of the past seven seasons. Incredibly, Kelce was a top-10 fantasy scorer in 76% of his games, whereas only two other tight ends were over 50%. Kansas City didn't make any major offseason adds at wideout, so Kelce remains locked in as Patrick Mahomes' top target. Kelce is the clear-cut No. 1 TE in fantasy and the 33-year-old should be selected in the middle of the first round in drafts.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":9.8,"externalId":"401437961","id":"01401437961","proTeamId":12,"scoringPeriodId":18,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":6.0,"42":38.0,"47":7.0,"48":3.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":6.0,"54":1.0,"58":7.0,"59":11.0,"60":6.333,"61":38.0,"155":1.0,"210":1.0,"213":2.0}},{"appliedTotal":11.3,"externalId":"401437937","id":"01401437937","proTeamId":12,"scoringPeriodId":17,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":7.0,"42":43.0,"47":8.0,"48":4.0,"49":2.0,"50":1.0,"53":7.0,"54":1.0,"58":10.0,"59":21.0,"60":6.143,"61":43.0,"155":1.0,"210":1.0,"213":4.0}},{"appliedAverage":18.535705173733334,"appliedTotal":278.035577606,"externalId":"2023","id":"102023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":3.67675309,"24":14.65190376,"25":0.431367697,"26":0.023573241,"27":2.0,"28":1.0,"35":0.006756342,"36":0.004729439,"37":4.50446E-4,"38":1.5372E-5,"39":3.985011612,"40":0.969192077,"42":1141.826712,"43":9.917383339,"44":0.461687011,"45":0.226022009,"46":0.147705383,"47":228.0,"48":114.0,"49":57.0,"50":45.0,"51":22.0,"53":100.6867599,"54":20.0,"55":10.0,"56":3.485737307,"57":0.107806308,"58":136.2901607,"60":11.3403859,"61":75.52939342,"62":0.485260252,"63":0.005515705,"66":0.044163562,"67":1.209405663,"68":1.253569226,"70":0.020315239,"71":0.677267171,"72":0.69758241,"73":0.69758241,"210":15.11764706,"212":3.111675851,"213":57.34259772}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2023","id":"002023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":18.605882352941176,"appliedTotal":316.3,"externalId":"2022","id":"002022","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":2.0,"24":5.0,"39":2.5,"40":0.29411765,"41":110.0,"42":1338.0,"43":12.0,"44":1.0,"47":262.0,"48":126.0,"49":58.0,"50":46.0,"51":20.0,"52":6.0,"53":110.0,"54":15.0,"55":2.0,"56":6.0,"58":152.0,"59":648.0,"60":12.16363636,"61":78.70588235,"67":1.0,"68":1.0,"71":1.0,"72":1.0,"73":1.0,"108":2.0,"109":2.0,"155":14.0,"156":3.0,"158":74.0,"183":8.0,"184":2.0,"186":2.0,"210":17.0,"213":75.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":1,"totalRanking":12,"totalRating":316.3}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1690700400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":3116406,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":51,"published":false,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":51,"published":false,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":false,"eligibleSlots":[3,4,5,23,7,20,21],"firstName":"Tyreek","fullName":"Tyreek Hill","id":3116406,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"10","lastName":"Hill","lastNewsDate":1690382538000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":50.360479041916165,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0601318196939431,"averageDraftPosition":8.271802971225506,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":-0.021705702530463,"date":1690549510863,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0075074266453754035,"percentOwned":99.87069040837368,"percentStarted":99.26171212889021},"proTeamId":15,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":3.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":12,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":3.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":10,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}]},"seasonOutlook":"Hill's first season with the Dolphins went about as well as it could have from a fantasy perspective.

Hill scored eight TDs, and that number likely would've been higher with a healthy Tua Tagovailoa (he caught zero TDs in games Tagovailoa was out or left injured). Hill remains in his prime at age 29 and is on the short list of players with a legitimate shot to lead the WR position in fantasy

Robinson's collegiate rushing efficiency was elite, as he posted a 4.1 YAC (fourth in this year's rookie class) and 3.0 forced missed tackle rate (first) during 31 games. He's also a capable receiver, having posted a 60-805-8 line in his career, which included a class best YPR (13.4) and YPT (9.8). All six RBs drafted in the top 10 since 2011 have finished their rookie season top 15 in fantasy PPG (three finished top five), which only adds to Robinson's 2023 appeal.

Henry expanded his game a bit as well, setting career-high marks in targets, receptions and receiving yards, while pacing all backs in yards per reception and yards per target.

After injuries cost him 21 games during the 2019-21 seasons, Barkley bounced back in a big way in 2022, pacing the position in snaps and finishing top five in carries, targets, touches, scrimmage yards and fantasy points. Barkley's efficiency hasn't quite jumped off the page, especially as a receiver (4.5 YPT on 135 targets over the past two seasons), and we did see a bit of a drop-off as the 2022 season progressed (third in PPG during Weeks 1-10, 12th from Week 11 on). Still, he's in his prime at age 26, one of the league's most gifted backs and sees a ton of volume as both a rusher and receiver. Barkley is a strong RB1.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"401437957","id":"01401437957","proTeamId":19,"scoringPeriodId":18,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedTotal":7.300000000000001,"externalId":"401437939","id":"01401437939","proTeamId":19,"scoringPeriodId":17,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":12.0,"24":58.0,"27":11.0,"28":5.0,"29":2.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"39":4.833,"40":58.0,"41":2.0,"42":-5.0,"53":2.0,"58":4.0,"59":3.0,"60":-2.5,"61":-5.0,"155":1.0,"210":1.0,"212":2.0}},{"appliedAverage":18.20942268257143,"appliedTotal":254.931917556,"externalId":"2023","id":"102023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":236.3028418,"24":1014.386322,"25":7.783399827,"26":0.298170529,"27":202.0,"28":101.0,"29":50.0,"30":40.0,"31":20.0,"33":47.0,"34":23.0,"35":0.489458294,"36":0.342620806,"37":2.682987382,"38":0.091560066,"39":4.292738566,"40":71.55422191,"42":430.2832865,"43":1.853044114,"44":0.107272661,"45":0.052234061,"46":0.034134959,"47":86.0,"48":43.0,"49":21.0,"50":17.0,"51":8.0,"53":53.41610377,"54":10.0,"55":5.0,"56":0.266398798,"57":0.008239138,"58":72.89203776,"60":8.055310218,"61":30.35193308,"62":0.40544319,"63":0.007474754,"66":1.385594849,"67":0.313212815,"68":1.698807664,"70":0.637373631,"71":0.175399176,"72":0.812772807,"73":0.812772807,"210":14.17647059,"212":56.48175871,"213":23.64884536}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2023","id":"002023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":17.75,"appliedTotal":284.0,"externalId":"2022","id":"002022","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":295.0,"24":1312.0,"25":10.0,"27":255.0,"28":125.0,"29":59.0,"30":45.0,"31":19.0,"32":4.0,"33":52.0,"34":23.0,"37":4.0,"39":4.44745763,"40":82.0,"41":57.0,"42":338.0,"44":1.0,"47":63.0,"48":27.0,"49":9.0,"50":6.0,"53":57.0,"54":4.0,"58":76.0,"59":434.0,"60":5.92982456,"61":21.125,"66":1.0,"68":1.0,"155":9.0,"156":6.0,"158":62.0,"179":7.0,"180":1.0,"181":1.0,"182":1.0,"210":16.0,"212":62.0,"213":10.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":5,"totalRanking":22,"totalRating":284.0}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1690700400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":3139477,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":32,"published":false,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":32,"published":false,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":false,"eligibleSlots":[0,7,20,21],"firstName":"Patrick","fullName":"Patrick Mahomes","id":3139477,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"15","lastName":"Mahomes","lastNewsDate":1684963103000,"lastVideoDate":1682899465000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":36.966467065868265,"auctionValueAverageChange":-1.236258658152181,"averageDraftPosition":13.479366176325403,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":-0.1352751973796522,"date":1690549519060,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.004030733673303644,"percentOwned":99.86890747489579,"percentStarted":98.6375116890835},"proTeamId":12,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":10,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":12,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.125,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":10,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}]},"seasonOutlook":"Many expected a step back for Mahomes last season following the departure of top target Tyreek Hill. So much for that. Mahomes proceeded to lead the league in passing yards (career-high 5,242), pass TDs (41) and fantasy points (417) en route to winning league MVP and the Super Bowl. Mahomes' fantasy floor was absurdly high, as his worst weekly finish was 13th in Week 2. He continues to load up the box score through the air and also posted career-high marks in rushing yards (358) and TDs (four) last season. Kansas City's WR room is unproven but has plenty of potential in youngsters Kadaraius Toney, Skyy Moore and Rashee Rice. Mahomes enters his age-27 season locked in as an elite fantasy option in Andy Reid's pass-heavy offense.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":14.98,"externalId":"401437961","id":"01401437961","proTeamId":12,"scoringPeriodId":18,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":26.0,"1":18.0,"2":8.0,"3":202.0,"4":1.0,"5":40.0,"6":20.0,"7":10.0,"8":8.0,"9":4.0,"10":2.0,"11":3.0,"12":1.0,"13":1.0,"21":69.23,"22":202.0,"23":3.0,"24":29.0,"27":5.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"39":9.667,"40":29.0,"64":2.0,"155":1.0,"158":6.0,"175":1.0,"210":1.0,"211":9.0,"212":2.0}},{"appliedTotal":25.520000000000003,"externalId":"401437937","id":"01401437937","proTeamId":12,"scoringPeriodId":17,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":42.0,"1":29.0,"2":13.0,"3":328.0,"4":3.0,"5":65.0,"6":32.0,"7":16.0,"8":13.0,"9":6.0,"10":3.0,"11":5.0,"12":2.0,"13":2.0,"14":1.0,"17":1.0,"20":1.0,"21":69.05,"22":328.0,"23":4.0,"24":8.0,"27":1.0,"39":2.0,"40":8.0,"41":1.0,"42":6.0,"47":1.0,"53":1.0,"58":1.0,"59":15.0,"60":6.0,"61":6.0,"73":1.0,"155":1.0,"158":18.0,"175":2.0,"176":1.0,"210":1.0,"211":18.0}},{"appliedAverage":23.1706882015,"appliedTotal":370.731011224,"externalId":"2023","id":"102023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":604.1625972,"1":398.3581042,"2":205.8044931,"3":4702.244923,"4":38.60185628,"5":940.0,"6":470.0,"7":235.0,"8":188.0,"9":94.0,"10":47.0,"11":79.0,"12":39.0,"15":4.554225593,"16":2.976186425,"17":6.747849583,"18":0.911457549,"19":1.796922019,"20":10.84735139,"21":0.659355786,"22":293.8903077,"23":59.14853452,"24":333.0011432,"25":3.326034074,"26":0.181782627,"27":66.0,"28":33.0,"29":16.0,"30":13.0,"31":6.0,"33":11.0,"34":5.0,"35":0.112181772,"36":0.078527241,"37":0.301859507,"38":0.010301307,"39":5.629913672,"40":20.81257145,"62":1.978704645,"63":0.034460691,"64":30.80011643,"65":7.164575232,"66":0.667400016,"68":7.831975249,"69":3.438996111,"70":0.307004008,"72":3.746000119,"73":14.59335151,"210":16.0,"211":226.6614489,"212":19.26702477}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2023","id":"002023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":24.552941176470586,"appliedTotal":417.4,"externalId":"2022","id":"002022","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":648.0,"1":435.0,"2":213.0,"3":5250.0,"4":41.0,"5":1043.0,"6":518.0,"7":256.0,"8":201.0,"9":96.0,"10":46.0,"11":81.0,"12":35.0,"13":35.0,"14":13.0,"15":4.0,"16":1.0,"17":8.0,"18":2.0,"19":2.0,"20":12.0,"21":0.6712963,"22":308.82352941,"23":61.0,"24":358.0,"25":4.0,"26":1.0,"27":65.0,"28":28.0,"29":12.0,"30":9.0,"31":1.0,"33":3.0,"39":5.86885246,"40":21.05882353,"41":1.0,"42":6.0,"47":1.0,"53":1.0,"58":1.0,"59":15.0,"60":6.0,"61":0.35294118,"64":26.0,"65":2.0,"66":4.0,"68":5.0,"73":12.0,"107":1.0,"108":1.0,"109":2.0,"155":14.0,"156":3.0,"158":272.0,"175":27.0,"176":7.0,"177":1.0,"178":2.0,"179":3.0,"180":1.0,"210":17.0,"211":273.0,"212":26.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":1,"totalRanking":1,"totalRating":417.40002}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1690700400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":4242335,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":2,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":58,"published":false,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":49,"published":false,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":false,"eligibleSlots":[2,3,23,7,20,21],"firstName":"Jonathan","fullName":"Jonathan

a breakout 2021 season, Taylor put up 2,171 yards and 20 TDs en route to leading all backs in fantasy points. Last season, he missed six games and was held to 1,004 yards and four TDs, ranking 18th in fantasy PPG (14th during 10 full games). Taylor's usage actually didn't change much (from 19.5 carries and 3.1 targets per game in 2021 to 19.2 carries and 3.9 targets per game in 2022), but his efficiency (3.6 yards per target ranked last at RB) and scoring plummeted. On the plus side, he finished strong (RB6 in fantasy PPG during the final four games) and he enters 2023 healthy and with a new coach (Shane Steichen) and QB (Anthony Richardson) in what is likely to be a run-heavy offense. Only 24 years old and positioned as a feature back, Taylor is set up for a big rebound season and remains a top-five fantasy RB.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"401437953","id":"01401437953","proTeamId":11,"scoringPeriodId":18,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"401437939","id":"01401437939","proTeamId":11,"scoringPeriodId":17,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":18.129695894,"appliedTotal":253.81574251600003,"externalId":"2023","id":"102023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":296.5327743,"24":1351.493565,"25":8.354062463,"26":0.283133928,"27":270.0,"28":135.0,"29":67.0,"30":54.0,"31":27.0,"33":59.0,"34":29.0,"35":0.632049786,"36":0.44243485,"37":4.747956584,"38":0.162029542,"39":4.557653259,"40":95.333571,"42":281.7630251,"43":1.135987347,"44":0.074169524,"45":0.046147114,"46":0.030157139,"47":56.0,"48":28.0,"49":14.0,"50":11.0,"51":5.0,"53":35.81548516,"54":7.0,"55":3.0,"56":0.114257013,"57":0.003533722,"58":49.41406451,"60":7.867072687,"61":19.87540011,"62":0.357303452,"63":0.014329137,"66":2.905672446,"67":0.350949633,"68":3.256622079,"70":1.336609325,"71":0.196531795,"72":1.53314112,"73":1.53314112,"210":14.17647059,"212":71.94888321,"213":15.24826199}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2023","id":"002023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":13.30909090909091,"appliedTotal":146.4,"externalId":"2022","id":"002022","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":192.0,"24":861.0,"25":4.0,"27":168.0,"28":82.0,"29":39.0,"30":30.0,"31":12.0,"32":2.0,"33":36.0,"34":17.0,"35":1.0,"36":1.0,"37":2.0,"39":4.484375,"40":78.27272727,"41":28.0,"42":143.0,"47":25.0,"48":11.0,"49":3.0,"50":1.0,"53":28.0,"54":1.0,"58":40.0,"59":204.0,"60":5.10714286,"61":13.0,"66":3.0,"68":3.0,"70":3.0,"72":3.0,"73":3.0,"155":2.0,"156":8.0,"158":24.0,"179":3.0,"210":11.0,"212":38.0,"213":4.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":33,"totalRanking":126,"totalRating":146.4}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1690700400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":4241389,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":42,"published":false,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":42,"published":false,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":false,"eligibleSlots":[3,4,5,23,7,20,21],"firstName":"CeeDee","fullName":"CeeDee Lamb","id":4241389,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"88","lastName":"Lamb","lastNewsDate":1690399033000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":39.32335329341317,"auctionValueAverageChange":-0.21497720062431114,"averageDraftPosition":16.669775935248246,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":-0.13623771012338892,"date":1690549524161,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.03289694485253847,"percentOwned":99.7352648225488,"percentStarted":98.08045153511455},"proTeamId":6,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":7.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":12,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":7.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":10,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}]},"seasonOutlook":"Following two solid but unspectacular fantasy seasons to begin his career, Lamb took his game to the next level in 2022. The 2020 first-round pick set career-high marks across the board and finished no lower than seventh among WRs in target share (28%), targets, receptions, yards, TDs and, of course, fantasy points. If there's one red flag here, it's that Lamb wasn't used much near the end zone (career-low six end zone targets) and ended up a bit lucky in the TD department (nine TDs, 5.4 expected). Of course, even if the TDs fall a bit, the 24-year-old is all but assured a massive target share and is one of the league's most-talented young receivers. Lamb is a midrange WR1, and it's possible we've yet to see his best

Incredibly, Jacobs has scored 40 rushing and zero receiving TDs in his career despite ranking top 15 at RB in receiving yards each of the past two seasons. Backs who see 300-plus carries tend to miss games and drop off the following season, but Jacobs can afford that and still provide midrange RB1 value. The 25-year-old is worth a look at the Round 1/2 turn.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":7.0,"externalId":"401437961","id":"01401437961","proTeamId":13,"scoringPeriodId":18,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":17.0,"24":45.0,"27":9.0,"28":4.0,"29":2.0,"30":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"39":2.647,"40":45.0,"41":2.0,"42":5.0,"47":1.0,"53":2.0,"58":3.0,"59":8.0,"60":2.5,"61":5.0,"156":1.0,"210":1.0,"212":3.0}},{"appliedTotal":19.5,"externalId":"401437943","id":"01401437943","proTeamId":13,"scoringPeriodId":17,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":17.0,"24":69.0,"25":1.0,"27":13.0,"28":6.0,"29":3.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"39":4.059,"40":69.0,"41":4.0,"42":26.0,"47":5.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":4.0,"58":5.0,"59":18.0,"60":6.5,"61":26.0,"156":1.0,"158":6.0,"179":1.0,"210":1.0,"212":4.0,"213":2.0}},{"appliedAverage":17.91520682,"appliedTotal":250.81289548000004,"externalId":"2023","id":"102023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":260.7908992,"24":1164.274093,"25":9.461236355,"26":0.38141158,"27":232.0,"28":116.0,"29":58.0,"30":46.0,"31":23.0,"33":52.0,"34":26.0,"35":0.546500113,"36":0.382550079,"37":3.520465771,"38":0.12013999,"39":4.464396942,"40":82.12721817,"42":307.3637562,"43":0.988044014,"44":0.055391852,"45":0.047309102,"46":0.030916498,"47":61.0,"48":30.0,"49":15.0,"50":12.0,"51":6.0,"53":42.25852596,"54":8.0,"55":4.0,"56":0.132224737,"57":0.004089425,"58":53.54959539,"60":7.273414045,"61":21.68126081,"62":0.436803432,"63":0.010403055,"66":2.034638228,"67":0.329692534,"68":2.364330762,"70":0.935933585,"71":0.184627819,"72":1.120561404,"73":1.120561404,"210":14.17647059,"212":64.28132503,"213":17.36231487}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2023","id":"002023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":19.311764705882354,"appliedTotal":328.3,"externalId":"2022","id":"002022","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":340.0,"24":1653.0,"25":12.0,"27":320.0,"28":155.0,"29":75.0,"30":56.0,"31":23.0,"32":7.0,"33":62.0,"34":27.0,"35":1.0,"36":1.0,"37":5.0,"38":1.0,"39":4.86176471,"40":97.23529412,"41":53.0,"42":400.0,"47":75.0,"48":33.0,"49":11.0,"50":9.0,"51":2.0,"53":53.0,"54":5.0,"58":64.0,"59":374.0,"60":7.54716981,"61":23.52941176,"66":2.0,"67":1.0,"68":3.0,"71":1.0,"72":1.0,"73":1.0,"107":1.0,"108":2.0,"109":3.0,"155":6.0,"156":11.0,"158":72.0,"179":7.0,"180":2.0,"181":1.0,"182":1.0,"210":17.0,"212":91.0,"213":16.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":3,"totalRanking":10,"totalRating":328.3}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1690700400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":4047646,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":40,"published":false,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":36,"published":false,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":false,"eligibleSlots":[3,4,5,23,7,20,21],"firstName":"A.J.","fullName":"A.J.

He also matched a career-high with 11 TDs, which ranked second among WRs.

The first-round pick out of Ohio State finished sixth in targets and fifth in end zone targets (13), which powered him to a 21st-place finish in fantasy points. Improved QB play would've pushed Wilson even higher, as he was held to four TDs (7.9 expected) and his 56% catch rate ranked near the basement of the league. Help is, of course, on the way, as the Jets traded for Aaron Rodgers during the offseason. With the future MVP under center, the sky is the limit for Wilson. The 23-year-old is a fringe fantasy WR1 with elite upside.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":17.9,"externalId":"401437955","id":"01401437955","proTeamId":20,"scoringPeriodId":18,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":9.0,"42":89.0,"47":17.0,"48":8.0,"49":4.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"53":9.0,"54":1.0,"58":17.0,"59":22.0,"60":9.889,"61":89.0,"156":1.0,"210":1.0,"213":5.0}},{"appliedTotal":4.8,"externalId":"401437944","id":"01401437944","proTeamId":20,"scoringPeriodId":17,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":3.0,"42":18.0,"47":3.0,"48":1.0,"53":3.0,"58":11.0,"59":3.0,"60":6.0,"61":18.0,"156":1.0,"210":1.0,"213":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":16.021022879066667,"appliedTotal":240.315343186,"externalId":"2023","id":"102023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":4.243332379,"24":24.29468408,"25":0.149059718,"26":0.008007776,"27":4.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"35":0.007799909,"36":0.005459936,"37":0.001355186,"38":4.62473E-5,"39":5.725378527,"40":1.60704136,"42":1087.591526,"43":8.267562447,"44":0.396998755,"45":0.223045049,"46":0.145759939,"47":217.0,"48":108.0,"49":54.0,"50":43.0,"51":21.0,"53":79.63458051,"54":15.0,"55":7.0,"56":3.106654303,"57":0.096082092,"58":130.1672183,"60":13.65727702,"61":71.94185195,"62":0.405006531,"63":0.007381256,"66":0.084866648,"67":1.59269161,"68":1.677558258,"70":0.039038658,"71":0.891907302,"72":0.93094596,"73":0.93094596,"210":15.11764706,"212":3.261227802,"213":50.37388063}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2023","id":"002023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":12.688235294117648,"appliedTotal":215.70000000000002,"externalId":"2022","id":"002022","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":1.0,"2":1.0,"23":4.0,"24":4.0,"27":1.0,"39":1.0,"40":0.23529412,"41":83.0,"42":1103.0,"43":4.0,"45":1.0,"46":1.0,"47":214.0,"48":103.0,"49":47.0,"50":36.0,"51":14.0,"52":3.0,"53":83.0,"54":8.0,"56":3.0,"58":147.0,"59":384.0,"60":13.28915663,"61":64.88235294,"66":1.0,"67":1.0,"68":2.0,"71":1.0,"72":1.0,"73":1.0,"108":1.0,"109":1.0,"155":7.0,"156":10.0,"158":24.0,"183":2.0,"184":1.0,"210":17.0,"213":55.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":21,"totalRanking":54,"totalRating":215.7}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1690700400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":3918298,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":31,"published":false,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":31,"published":false,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":false,"eligibleSlots":[0,7,20,21],"firstName":"Josh","fullName":"Josh Allen","id":3918298,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"17","lastName":"Allen","lastNewsDate":1678761558000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":30.17125748502994,"auctionValueAverageChange":-1.326187148700896,"averageDraftPosition":20.851021818540822,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":-0.13510050303444388,"date":1690549509564,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":-0.00461076207567146,"percentOwned":99.84268896987494,"percentStarted":95.06567735507721},"proTeamId":2,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":10,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":12,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.875,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}]},"seasonOutlook":"Allen is entering his sixth NFL campaign after finishing no lower than second in fantasy points among QBs each of the last three seasons. The 27-year-old was his usual dominant self in 2022, posting 13 top-10 fantasy outings, which tied Patrick Mahomes for the most (in one fewer game). Allen continues to get the job done through the air (no lower than eighth in passing yards and TDs each of the last three seasons) and on the ground (no lower than seventh among QBs in rushing yards and TDs all five seasons). Allen's supporting cast is a bit underwhelming behind Stefon Diggs, but his dual-threat game in Buffalo's pass-heavy offense locks him in as an elite fantasy option.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":21.759999999999998,"externalId":"401437949","id":"01401437949","proTeamId":2,"scoringPeriodId":18,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":31.0,"1":19.0,"2":12.0,"3":254.0,"4":3.0,"5":50.0,"6":25.0,"7":12.0,"8":10.0,"9":5.0,"10":2.0,"11":3.0,"12":1.0,"13":2.0,"14":1.0,"15":2.0,"20":1.0,"21":61.29,"22":254.0,"23":9.0,"24":16.0,"27":3.0,"28":1.0,"33":1.0,"39":1.778,"40":16.0,"64":2.0,"73":1.0,"155":1.0,"158":18.0,"175":1.0,"210":1.0,"211":10.0,"212":3.0}},{"appliedTotal":22.98,"externalId":"401437920","id":"01401437920","proTeamId":2,"scoringPeriodId":16,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":26.0,"1":15.0,"2":11.0,"3":172.0,"4":2.0,"5":34.0,"6":17.0,"7":8.0,"8":6.0,"9":3.0,"10":1.0,"11":3.0,"12":1.0,"13":2.0,"14":1.0,"19":1.0,"20":2.0,"21":57.69,"22":172.0,"23":6.0,"24":41.0,"25":1.0,"27":8.0,"28":4.0,"29":2.0,"30":1.0,"33":1.0,"39":6.833,"40":41.0,"64":1.0,"66":1.0,"68":1.0,"73":2.0,"155":1.0,"158":18.0,"176":2.0,"179":1.0,"210":1.0,"211":9.0,"212":4.0}},{"appliedAverage":22.384605579375005,"appliedTotal":358.1536892700001,"externalId":"2023","id":"102023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":576.1313103,"1":366.669956,"2":209.4613543,"3":4178.783633,"4":30.664518,"5":835.0,"6":417.0,"7":208.0,"8":167.0,"9":83.0,"10":41.0,"11":73.0,"12":36.0,"15":3.655566319,"16":2.38891259,"17":4.254619078,"18":0.57468748,"19":1.523378665,"20":12.76039674,"21":0.636434697,"22":261.1739771,"23":112.9966467,"24":630.9652357,"25":6.279989374,"26":0.303733576,"27":126.0,"28":63.0,"29":31.0,"30":25.0,"31":12.0,"33":22.0,"34":11.0,"35":0.220769878,"36":0.154538915,"37":1.088957806,"38":0.037161952,"39":5.58392885,"40":39.43532723,"62":1.82711224,"63":0.050129452,"64":36.77410914,"65":9.61957115,"66":1.773486167,"68":11.39305732,"69":4.617394152,"70":0.815803637,"72":5.433197789,"73":18.19359453,"210":16.0,"211":202.7753859,"212":34.80150135}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2023","id":"002023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":24.72,"appliedTotal":395.52,"externalId":"2022","id":"002022","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":567.0,"1":359.0,"2":208.0,"3":4283.0,"4":35.0,"5":849.0,"6":421.0,"7":206.0,"8":163.0,"9":79.0,"10":37.0,"11":65.0,"12":27.0,"13":36.0,"14":15.0,"15":6.0,"16":3.0,"17":4.0,"18":2.0,"19":1.0,"20":14.0,"21":0.63315697,"22":267.6875,"23":124.0,"24":762.0,"25":7.0,"26":1.0,"27":147.0,"28":69.0,"29":31.0,"30":22.0,"31":6.0,"33":20.0,"34":6.0,"39":6.14516129,"40":47.625,"64":33.0,"65":6.0,"66":7.0,"68":13.0,"69":3.0,"70":2.0,"72":5.0,"73":19.0,"108":3.0,"109":3.0,"155":13.0,"156":3.0,"158":254.0,"175":13.0,"176":11.0,"177":4.0,"178":1.0,"179":6.0,"180":1.0,"182":1.0,"210":16.0,"211":211.0,"212":54.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":2,"totalRanking":2,"totalRating":395.52002}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1690700400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":4040715,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":30,"published":false,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":30,"published":false,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":false,"eligibleSlots":[0,7,20,21],"firstName":"Jalen","fullName":"Jalen

returns for his third season as the Eagles' starting QB after a breakout 2022 campaign in which he was in the MVP conversation and led his team to an NFC title. Hurts actually paced all QBs in fantasy points per game (25.2) and was a top-six scorer at the position in eight consecutive weeks. The 25-year-old led all QBs in carries (165) and rush TDs (13), and his heavy goal line role allowed 20 carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line, which ranked second in the entire league. Hurts is set up for success again in 2023, with an elite offensive line and a terrific group of targets led by A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith and Dallas Goedert.

has finally found his way atop the depth chart in Dallas following the offseason release of Ezekiel Elliott. After three seasons as a change-of-pace back, the 2019 fourth-round pick proved too good to keep off the field and was operating in a near-even split with Elliott in 2022. Pollard finished 21st among backs in touches, but was 12th in yardage, sixth in TDs and eighth in fantasy points. Absurdly efficient, Pollard ranks third in rushing EPA per carry, third in yards per carry (5.13) and first in YAC (2.43) since he was drafted. Pollard has shown that he can provide high-end efficiency with added volume and will be working behind a good offensive line in Dallas. He's a top-10 fantasy option.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":1.9000000000000001,"externalId":"401437959","id":"01401437959","proTeamId":6,"scoringPeriodId":18,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":7.0,"24":19.0,"27":3.0,"28":1.0,"33":1.0,"39":2.714,"40":19.0,"58":1.0,"156":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"401437932","id":"01401437932","proTeamId":6,"scoringPeriodId":17,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":17.44801784957143,"appliedTotal":244.272249894,"externalId":"2023","id":"102023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":243.4014296,"24":1159.310695,"25":7.991880858,"26":0.319548964,"27":231.0,"28":115.0,"29":57.0,"30":46.0,"31":23.0,"33":48.0,"34":24.0,"35":0.505797408,"36":0.354058186,"37":3.495061975,"38":0.119273056,"39":4.762957623,"40":81.77710294,"42":318.8918108,"43":1.701295372,"44":0.094620295,"45":0.065780653,"46":0.042987657,"47":63.0,"48":31.0,"49":15.0,"50":12.0,"51":6.0,"53":38.95003309,"54":7.0,"55":3.0,"56":0.140952983,"57":0.004359371,"58":50.97375114,"60":8.187202564,"61":22.49444308,"62":0.414169259,"63":0.007095054,"66":1.390068114,"67":0.222444047,"68":1.612512161,"70":0.639431333,"71":0.124568666,"72":0.763999999,"73":0.763999999,"210":14.17647059,"212":61.96186136,"213":17.21775838}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2023","id":"002023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":15.55,"appliedTotal":248.8,"externalId":"2022","id":"002022","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":193.0,"24":1007.0,"25":9.0,"27":196.0,"28":94.0,"29":44.0,"30":33.0,"31":12.0,"32":3.0,"33":31.0,"34":11.0,"35":2.0,"36":2.0,"37":3.0,"39":5.21761658,"40":62.9375,"41":39.0,"42":371.0,"43":3.0,"45":1.0,"46":1.0,"47":70.0,"48":32.0,"49":13.0,"50":10.0,"51":4.0,"52":1.0,"53":39.0,"54":2.0,"56":1.0,"58":55.0,"59":347.0,"60":9.51282051,"61":23.1875,"108":1.0,"109":1.0,"155":11.0,"156":5.0,"158":72.0,"179":3.0,"180":3.0,"182":1.0,"184":1.0,"186":1.0,"210":16.0,"212":46.0,"213":17.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":8,"totalRanking":30,"totalRating":248.8}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1690700400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":4372016,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":30,"published":false,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":35,"published":false,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[3,4,5,23,7,20,21],"firstName":"Jaylen","fullName":"Jaylen Waddle","id":4372016,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"17","lastName":"Waddle","lastNewsDate":1673821682000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":31.18562874251497,"auctionValueAverageChange":-0.5043201501596464,"averageDraftPosition":23.90321306944376,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":-0.009475074822166363,"date":1690549523411,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":-0.007868631554757144,"percentOwned":99.71866426686704,"percentStarted":95.43834204134411},"proTeamId":15,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":11.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":12,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":10.875,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":10,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}]},"seasonOutlook":"Waddle has finished each of his first two NFL seasons as a top-15 fantasy WR, but he took very different paths each year. As a rookie in 2021, Waddle was a short-range target (7.0 aDOT) and caught 104 passes for 1,015 yards and six TDs. Last season, Waddle played more of a downfield role (12.0 aDOT) and led all WRs in yards per reception (18.1) and yards per target (11.6) while finishing second in RAC (7.0). His reception total plummeted, but his yardage skyrocketed and his numbers actually would've been better if Tua Tagovailoa missed less time (287 yards and zero TDs in five games Tagovailoa was out or left injured). More goal line work would be nice (he has eight career end zone targets), but Waddle is a budding star and a featured target in a good offense.

Etienne had some terrible TD luck (five TDs despite ranking 10th among backs in both yards and expected TDs -- 9.2) and is a good bet for a boost this season. Etienne is the lead back in a good, emerging Jaguars offense and has the skill set to be a threat as a rusher and receiver. He's a fringe RB1 with elite upside.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":5.4,"externalId":"401437954","id":"01401437954","proTeamId":30,"scoringPeriodId":18,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":7.0,"24":17.0,"27":3.0,"28":1.0,"33":1.0,"39":2.429,"40":17.0,"41":2.0,"42":17.0,"47":3.0,"48":1.0,"53":2.0,"58":2.0,"59":11.0,"60":8.5,"61":17.0,"155":1.0,"210":1.0,"212":2.0,"213":2.0}},{"appliedTotal":23.0,"externalId":"401437936","id":"01401437936","proTeamId":30,"scoringPeriodId":17,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":9.0,"24":108.0,"25":1.0,"27":21.0,"28":10.0,"29":5.0,"30":4.0,"31":2.0,"32":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":1.0,"36":1.0,"37":1.0,"39":12.0,"40":108.0,"41":3.0,"42":32.0,"47":6.0,"48":3.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":3.0,"58":3.0,"59":26.0,"60":10.667,"61":32.0,"155":1.0,"158":6.0,"210":1.0,"212":2.0,"213":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":15.84024721814286,"appliedTotal":221.76346105400003,"externalId":"2023","id":"102023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":225.6385575,"24":1027.848804,"25":6.352440882,"26":0.284566362,"27":205.0,"28":102.0,"29":51.0,"30":41.0,"31":20.0,"33":45.0,"34":22.0,"35":0.464925706,"36":0.325447994,"37":2.751355847,"38":0.093893219,"39":4.555288843,"40":72.50385752,"42":324.5218304,"43":1.741740857,"44":0.091566731,"45":0.063075062,"46":0.041219553,"47":64.0,"48":32.0,"49":16.0,"50":12.0,"51":6.0,"53":40.40567729,"54":8.0,"55":4.0,"56":0.144318413,"57":0.004463456,"58":52.35528961,"60":8.03158992,"61":22.8915814,"62":0.376133093,"63":0.015222487,"66":2.934218117,"67":0.525437991,"68":3.459656108,"70":1.349740334,"71":0.294245275,"72":1.643985609,"73":1.643985609,"210":14.17647059,"212":55.22165192,"213":17.72134035}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2023","id":"002023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":12.064705882352941,"appliedTotal":205.1,"externalId":"2022","id":"002022","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":220.0,"24":1125.0,"25":5.0,"26":1.0,"27":218.0,"28":105.0,"29":49.0,"30":37.0,"31":15.0,"32":5.0,"33":35.0,"34":14.0,"35":1.0,"36":1.0,"37":5.0,"39":5.11363636,"40":66.17647059,"41":35.0,"42":316.0,"47":57.0,"48":25.0,"49":9.0,"50":6.0,"53":35.0,"58":45.0,"59":354.0,"60":9.02857143,"61":18.58823529,"66":3.0,"67":2.0,"68":5.0,"70":3.0,"71":1.0,"72":3.0,"73":3.0,"155":9.0,"156":8.0,"158":32.0,"179":4.0,"210":17.0,"212":53.0,"213":16.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":17,"totalRanking":57,"totalRating":205.1}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1690700400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":4047650,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":36,"published":false,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":30,"published":false,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[3,4,5,23,7,20,21],"firstName":"DK","fullName":"DK

Higgins is 6-foot-4, so it's a bit surprising that he has yet to clear seven TDs in a season and that he only saw five end zone targets last season (46 WRs had more). Nonetheless, the 24-year-old is a big part of a high-scoring, pass-heavy Bengals' offense, which positions him as a good fantasy WR2.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":1.7000000000000002,"externalId":"401437951","id":"01401437951","proTeamId":4,"scoringPeriodId":18,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":1.0,"42":7.0,"47":1.0,"53":1.0,"58":7.0,"60":7.0,"61":7.0,"155":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedTotal":26.8,"externalId":"401437924","id":"01401437924","proTeamId":4,"scoringPeriodId":16,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":8.0,"42":128.0,"43":1.0,"47":25.0,"48":12.0,"49":6.0,"50":5.0,"51":2.0,"52":1.0,"53":8.0,"54":1.0,"56":1.0,"58":9.0,"59":35.0,"60":16.0,"61":128.0,"155":1.0,"158":6.0,"183":1.0,"210":1.0,"213":4.0}},{"appliedAverage":15.249951905466666,"appliedTotal":228.749278582,"externalId":"2023","id":"102023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"42":1050.617685,"43":7.015115913,"44":0.34228678,"45":0.247670881,"46":0.16185292,"47":210.0,"48":105.0,"49":52.0,"50":42.0,"51":21.0,"53":82.02422216,"54":16.0,"55":8.0,"56":2.854101647,"57":0.088271185,"58":122.7066901,"60":12.80862722,"61":69.49611146,"62":0.34228678,"63":0.004473955,"67":1.016807898,"68":1.016807898,"71":0.569412423,"72":0.569412423,"73":0.569412423,"210":15.11764706,"213":49.38682031}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2023","id":"002023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":13.80625,"appliedTotal":220.9,"externalId":"2022","id":"002022","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":74.0,"42":1029.0,"43":7.0,"44":1.0,"45":2.0,"46":1.0,"47":199.0,"48":96.0,"49":45.0,"50":33.0,"51":12.0,"52":4.0,"53":74.0,"54":10.0,"56":4.0,"58":109.0,"59":286.0,"60":13.90540541,"61":64.3125,"155":12.0,"156":4.0,"158":44.0,"183":3.0,"184":1.0,"185":1.0,"210":16.0,"213":46.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":19,"totalRanking":50,"totalRating":220.9}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1690700400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":3915511,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":19,"published":false,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":19,"published":false,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[0,7,20,21],"firstName":"Joe","fullName":"Joe Burrow","id":3915511,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"QUESTIONABLE","jersey":"9","lastName":"Burrow","lastNewsDate":1690498458000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":20.07065868263473,"auctionValueAverageChange":-0.5559235958462843,"averageDraftPosition":31.41652680422549,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":-0.778259656211052,"date":1690549505401,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":-0.046628207068579286,"percentOwned":99.67139473707209,"percentStarted":89.14291707086862},"proTeamId":4,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":10,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":12,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.375,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}]},"seasonOutlook":"Burrow's progression continued last season, as the 2020 No. 1 pick finished fourth among QBs in fantasy points and top-10 weeks (nine) while ranking no lower than fifth in pass attempts, completions, yards and TDs.

After totaling a 40-118-2 rushing line in 2021, Burrow finished no lower than eighth among QBs in carries (75), rush TDs (five) and carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line (seven) last season.

The 24-year-old is still on the ascent and, even with Brown in the mix, has a path to another top 15 fantasy campaign in the Eagles' elite offense.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":13.7,"externalId":"401437957","id":"01401437957","proTeamId":21,"scoringPeriodId":18,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":7.0,"42":67.0,"47":13.0,"48":6.0,"49":3.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":7.0,"54":1.0,"58":8.0,"59":50.0,"60":9.571,"61":67.0,"155":1.0,"210":1.0,"213":3.0}},{"appliedTotal":20.5,"externalId":"401437940","id":"01401437940","proTeamId":21,"scoringPeriodId":17,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":9.0,"42":115.0,"47":23.0,"48":11.0,"49":5.0,"50":4.0,"51":2.0,"52":1.0,"53":9.0,"54":1.0,"56":1.0,"58":13.0,"59":57.0,"60":12.778,"61":115.0,"156":1.0,"210":1.0,"213":5.0}},{"appliedAverage":14.690713226000002,"appliedTotal":220.36069839,"externalId":"2023","id":"102023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"42":1016.46892,"43":6.631503987,"44":0.46666708,"45":0.228233617,"46":0.149150669,"47":203.0,"48":101.0,"49":50.0,"50":40.0,"51":20.0,"53":79.30934867,"54":15.0,"55":7.0,"56":2.623167766,"57":0.0811289,"58":120.9543808,"60":12.81650823,"61":67.23724374,"62":0.46666708,"63":0.005302452,"67":1.205102745,"68":1.205102745,"71":0.674857537,"72":0.674857537,"73":0.674857537,"210":15.11764706,"213":47.66945721}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2023","id":"002023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":14.976470588235296,"appliedTotal":254.60000000000002,"externalId":"2022","id":"002022","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":95.0,"42":1196.0,"43":7.0,"45":1.0,"47":232.0,"48":112.0,"49":53.0,"50":40.0,"51":17.0,"52":5.0,"53":95.0,"54":14.0,"55":1.0,"56":5.0,"58":136.0,"59":476.0,"60":12.58947368,"61":70.35294118,"67":1.0,"68":1.0,"71":1.0,"72":1.0,"73":1.0,"115":15.0,"118":1.0,"155":14.0,"156":3.0,"158":42.0,"183":3.0,"184":2.0,"186":1.0,"210":17.0,"213":56.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":9,"totalRanking":28,"totalRating":254.6}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1690700400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":3116365,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":4,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":18,"published":false,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":18,"published":false,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[5,6,23,7,20,21],"firstName":"Mark","fullName":"Mark Andrews","id":3116365,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"89","lastName":"Andrews","lastNewsDate":1673845733000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":19.216766467065867,"auctionValueAverageChange":-0.1631313182833658,"averageDraftPosition":33.99693993386309,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.1546543803896938,"date":1690549510952,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0031683809668123786,"percentOwned":99.74836612728481,"percentStarted":98.5059238807535},"proTeamId":33,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":10,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.125,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":12,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}]},"seasonOutlook":"Andrews has finished now lower than sixth among TEs in fantasy points during each of his four seasons as Baltimore's No. 1 tight end.

Lamar Jackson's injury loomed large, as Andrews posted a 49-568-5 receiving line in nine full games with Jackson (15.4 fantasy PPG, ranked second), compared to 21-246-0 in five games without him (9.1 PPG, 17th). Baltimore upgraded at wide receiver a bit, but Andrews can afford a dip from his TE-high 29% target share and still provide elite fantasy numbers.

The good news is that he has remained a strong fantasy option when healthy. Despite posting a career-low 6.9 YPA on 326 pass attempts last season, Jackson was fifth among QBs in fantasy points per game prior to his Week 13 injury. Jackson finished the season second at the position in rushing yards and has yet to finish a season lower than second in the category. Jackson's targets are much improved this season, with Odell Beckham Jr. and Zay Flowers added to a group that includes Mark Andrews and Rashod Bateman. Jackson's dual-threat ability and the potential for more passing under new playcaller Todd Monken is enough to make him a midrange QB1 with elite upside.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"401437951","id":"01401437951","proTeamId":33,"scoringPeriodId":18,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"401437934","id":"01401437934","proTeamId":33,"scoringPeriodId":17,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":21.715172614133333,"appliedTotal":325.727589212,"externalId":"2023","id":"102023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":445.8672613,"1":280.298537,"2":165.5687243,"3":3261.481989,"4":24.96892465,"5":652.0,"6":326.0,"7":163.0,"8":130.0,"9":65.0,"10":32.0,"11":56.0,"12":28.0,"15":2.443682163,"16":1.596946293,"17":2.03714939,"18":0.275165468,"19":1.435182396,"20":11.48350511,"21":0.628659158,"22":217.4321326,"23":144.6719093,"24":934.2391065,"25":4.989541959,"26":0.189919326,"27":186.0,"28":93.0,"29":46.0,"30":37.0,"31":18.0,"33":28.0,"34":14.0,"35":0.288996272,"36":0.202297391,"37":2.552425954,"38":0.087104505,"39":6.457639987,"40":62.2826071,"62":1.625101722,"63":0.039278756,"64":35.68559849,"65":6.864655974,"66":2.062334106,"68":8.92699008,"69":3.295034867,"70":0.948673689,"72":4.243708556,"73":15.72721367,"210":15.0,"211":156.5814645,"212":45.88210124}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2023","id":"002023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":18.16,"appliedTotal":236.08,"externalId":"2022","id":"002022","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":326.0,"1":203.0,"2":123.0,"3":2242.0,"4":17.0,"5":442.0,"6":219.0,"7":105.0,"8":83.0,"9":40.0,"10":19.0,"11":35.0,"12":14.0,"13":20.0,"14":7.0,"15":2.0,"16":2.0,"17":1.0,"19":1.0,"20":7.0,"21":0.62269939,"22":172.46153846,"23":112.0,"24":764.0,"25":3.0,"27":146.0,"28":69.0,"29":31.0,"30":25.0,"31":10.0,"32":2.0,"33":18.0,"34":7.0,"35":1.0,"36":1.0,"37":2.0,"39":6.82142857,"40":58.76923077,"64":26.0,"65":4.0,"66":2.0,"68":5.0,"69":2.0,"70":1.0,"72":2.0,"73":9.0,"108":1.0,"109":1.0,"155":8.0,"156":5.0,"158":120.0,"175":6.0,"176":7.0,"177":2.0,"179":2.0,"210":13.0,"211":103.0,"212":47.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":14,"totalRanking":39,"totalRating":236.08}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1690700400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":3042519,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":2,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":24,"published":false,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":24,"published":false,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[2,3,23,7,20,21],"firstName":"Aaron","fullName":"Aaron Jones","id":3042519,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"33","lastName":"Jones","lastNewsDate":1683746221000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":21.45508982035928,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.12289220536779766,"averageDraftPosition":36.27568848090021,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":-0.347380504874387,"date":1690549520005,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.01117651168392797,"percentOwned":98.90959607873975,"percentStarted":89.73377718364743},"proTeamId":9,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":10,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":12,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":16.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":14.125,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2}]},"seasonOutlook":"Jones enters 2023 looking for his fifth consecutive top-10 fantasy campaign. The 2017 fifth-round pick has been as reliable as they come, finishing inside the top 15 at RB in targets, receptions and scrimmage yards each of the past four seasons. His rushing efficiency has been nothing short of elite -- he sits second in yards per carry (5.1) among 40 RBs with 550-plus carries since he was drafted in 2017. Jones has 11 receiving TDs over the past two seasons, though his goal line work has been trending down (two carries inside the 5-yard line last season) and helps explain why he produced only three top-10 fantasy weeks in 2022. The 28-year-old will continue to share the backfield with AJ Dillon and the offense figures to lose some steam with Aaron Rodgers gone, so Jones is best viewed as a good RB2.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":7.800000000000001,"externalId":"401437952","id":"01401437952","proTeamId":9,"scoringPeriodId":18,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":12.0,"24":48.0,"27":9.0,"28":4.0,"29":2.0,"30":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"39":4.0,"40":48.0,"41":3.0,"42":20.0,"47":4.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"53":3.0,"58":4.0,"59":25.0,"60":6.667,"61":20.0,"67":1.0,"68":1.0,"71":1.0,"72":1.0,"73":1.0,"156":1.0,"210":1.0,"212":2.0}},{"appliedTotal":13.3,"externalId":"401437945","id":"01401437945","proTeamId":9,"scoringPeriodId":17,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":14.0,"24":111.0,"27":22.0,"28":11.0,"29":5.0,"30":4.0,"31":2.0,"32":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"37":1.0,"39":7.929,"40":111.0,"41":2.0,"42":2.0,"53":2.0,"58":3.0,"59":8.0,"60":1.0,"61":2.0,"155":1.0,"210":1.0,"212":5.0}},{"appliedAverage":16.104529557571432,"appliedTotal":225.46341380600003,"externalId":"2023","id":"102023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":193.663513,"24":956.3729067,"25":4.098184102,"26":0.185326483,"27":191.0,"28":95.0,"29":47.0,"30":38.0,"31":19.0,"33":38.0,"34":19.0,"35":0.392689498,"36":0.274882648,"37":2.366822233,"38":0.080770562,"39":4.93832262,"40":67.46198927,"42":401.7485912,"43":2.523158426,"44":0.133915097,"45":0.058232249,"46":0.038054775,"47":80.0,"48":40.0,"49":20.0,"50":16.0,"51":8.0,"53":51.94372795,"54":10.0,"55":5.0,"56":0.226185829,"57":0.006995438,"58":66.06393148,"60":7.73430416,"61":28.33911224,"62":0.31924158,"63":0.012500943,"66":2.240251266,"67":0.600872103,"68":2.84112337,"70":1.030515583,"71":0.336488378,"72":1.36700396,"73":1.36700396,"210":14.17647059,"212":49.18510689,"213":22.80038757}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2023","id":"002023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":14.623529411764707,"appliedTotal":248.60000000000002,"externalId":"2022","id":"002022","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":213.0,"24":1121.0,"25":2.0,"27":218.0,"28":105.0,"29":49.0,"30":36.0,"31":12.0,"32":5.0,"33":35.0,"34":13.0,"37":5.0,"39":5.2629108,"40":65.94117647,"41":59.0,"42":395.0,"43":5.0,"44":1.0,"47":73.0,"48":32.0,"49":12.0,"50":8.0,"51":2.0,"53":59.0,"54":3.0,"58":72.0,"59":447.0,"60":6.69491525,"61":23.23529412,"66":2.0,"67":2.0,"68":5.0,"71":2.0,"72":3.0,"73":3.0,"155":8.0,"156":9.0,"158":44.0,"180":2.0,"183":3.0,"185":2.0,"210":17.0,"212":56.0,"213":18.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":9,"totalRanking":31,"totalRating":248.6}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1690700400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":4569173,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":2,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":25,"published":false,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":26,"published":false,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[2,3,23,7,20,21],"firstName":"Rhamondre","fullName":"Rhamondre

playing a situational role as a rookie back in 2021, Stevenson took control of New England's feature back gig in his second season. The former fourth-round pick finished no lower than 10th among backs in touches (279), yards (1,461) and fantasy points, with his passing-game chops the primary driver of success (his 89 targets and 69 catches were both top five among RBs). Stevenson hasn't seen much work near the goal line, but he was unlucky in the TD department last season (six TDs, 8.0 expected). Ex-running mate Damien Harris is gone, leaving the likes of Ty Montgomery (who could steal significant passing down work), Pierre Strong Jr. and Kevin Harris as Stevenson's competition for touches. Perhaps new playcaller Bill O'Brien will lean more on a committee attack, but 25-year-old Stevenson's floor should be that of a good RB2.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":13.200000000000001,"externalId":"401437949","id":"01401437949","proTeamId":17,"scoringPeriodId":18,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":6.0,"24":54.0,"27":10.0,"28":5.0,"29":2.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":1.0,"39":9.0,"40":54.0,"41":5.0,"42":28.0,"47":5.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":5.0,"54":1.0,"58":6.0,"59":20.0,"60":5.6,"61":28.0,"66":1.0,"68":1.0,"156":1.0,"210":1.0,"212":2.0}},{"appliedTotal":7.1000000000000005,"externalId":"401437938","id":"01401437938","proTeamId":17,"scoringPeriodId":17,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":8.0,"24":42.0,"27":8.0,"28":4.0,"29":2.0,"30":1.0,"33":1.0,"39":5.25,"40":42.0,"41":2.0,"42":9.0,"47":1.0,"53":2.0,"58":4.0,"59":17.0,"60":4.5,"61":9.0,"155":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":15.512464323428572,"appliedTotal":217.174500528,"externalId":"2023","id":"102023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":208.7208222,"24":925.5458209,"25":6.118058991,"26":0.263179898,"27":185.0,"28":92.0,"29":46.0,"30":37.0,"31":18.0,"33":41.0,"34":20.0,"35":0.426437852,"36":0.298506497,"37":2.224768514,"38":0.075922814,"39":4.434372246,"40":65.28746455,"42":340.063838,"43":1.231727098,"44":0.067758436,"45":0.03929674,"46":0.025680419,"47":68.0,"48":34.0,"49":17.0,"50":13.0,"51":6.0,"53":48.56803847,"54":9.0,"55":4.0,"56":0.158840948,"57":0.004912607,"58":62.95141504,"60":7.001803012,"61":23.98790559,"62":0.330938334,"63":0.01282695,"66":2.364914817,"67":0.550300984,"68":2.9152158,"70":1.087860816,"71":0.308168551,"72":1.396029367,"73":1.396029367,"210":14.17647059,"212":50.56482045,"213":19.80184665}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2023","id":"002023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":14.652941176470588,"appliedTotal":249.1,"externalId":"2022","id":"002022","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":210.0,"24":1040.0,"25":5.0,"27":202.0,"28":97.0,"29":44.0,"30":34.0,"31":13.0,"32":2.0,"33":35.0,"34":12.0,"37":2.0,"39":4.95238095,"40":61.17647059,"41":69.0,"42":421.0,"43":1.0,"47":77.0,"48":35.0,"49":14.0,"50":11.0,"51":4.0,"53":69.0,"54":6.0,"58":88.0,"59":474.0,"60":6.10144928,"61":24.76470588,"66":1.0,"67":2.0,"68":4.0,"72":1.0,"73":1.0,"108":3.0,"109":3.0,"155":8.0,"156":9.0,"158":36.0,"179":3.0,"182":2.0,"183":1.0,"210":17.0,"212":51.0,"213":15.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":7,"totalRanking":29,"totalRating":249.1}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1690700400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":4241457,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":2,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":26,"published":false,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":25,"published":false,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[2,3,23,7,20,21],"firstName":"Najee","fullName":"Najee

leads the NFL with 694 touches since entering the league. The 2022 first-round pick has yet to miss a game and while he's ranked top five among RBs in carries both seasons, he did see a big drop-off in production from 2021 to 2022. Harris experienced a big dip in touches (381 to 313), yardage (1,667 to 1,263) and fantasy PPG (17.7 to 13.1) primarily due to a substantially decreased receiving role (from 94 targets to 54). On the plus side, Harris has scored 10 TDs in both pro seasons and he finished 2022 strong with five consecutive top-20 fantasy outings. The 25-year-old's role adjustment makes him more of a fringe RB1 than an elite fantasy back, but improvements along the line and at QB (Kenny Pickett's second season) are reasons for

had a bit of a setback last season, posting 864 yards and five TDs on 98 touches in 13 games. This after the versatile playmaker racked up 1,770 yards and 14 TDs on 136 touches in 2021. Samuel fell from third to 28th at wide receiver in fantasy PPG, and his season was horrifically inefficient; despite a position-low 4.0 aDOT, he caught only 61% of his targets and averaged 6.1 yards per target. Samuel's dual-threat role is not ideal for durability (he's yet to complete a full regular season in four years), but it is great for generating touches (7.75 per game last season). Even in a crowded offense, the heavy usage is enough to keep the 27 year old in the WR2 mix.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":4.4,"externalId":"401437962","id":"01401437962","proTeamId":25,"scoringPeriodId":18,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":1.0,"24":4.0,"39":4.0,"40":4.0,"41":2.0,"42":20.0,"47":4.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"53":2.0,"58":3.0,"59":28.0,"60":10.0,"61":20.0,"155":1.0,"210":1.0,"213":1.0}},{"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"401437943","id":"01401437943","proTeamId":25,"scoringPeriodId":17,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":15.424494065285714,"appliedTotal":215.942916914,"externalId":"2023","id":"102023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":43.60525929,"24":243.894476,"25":2.108941258,"26":0.07674888,"27":48.0,"28":24.0,"29":12.0,"30":9.0,"31":4.0,"33":8.0,"34":4.0,"35":0.081873278,"36":0.057311295,"37":0.152608667,"38":0.005207948,"39":5.593235311,"40":17.20417466,"42":888.2411449,"43":4.969392762,"44":0.296310445,"45":0.311114402,"46":0.203313262,"47":177.0,"48":88.0,"49":44.0,"50":35.0,"51":17.0,"53":61.64075177,"54":12.0,"55":6.0,"56":1.856966258,"57":0.057431946,"58":97.55582909,"60":14.40996613,"61":62.65601437,"62":0.373059325,"63":0.009261649,"66":0.872105186,"67":1.232815035,"68":2.104920221,"70":0.401168385,"71":0.69037642,"72":1.091544805,"73":1.091544805,"210":14.17647059,"212":14.52854293,"213":39.42651903}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2023","id":"002023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":12.953846153846154,"appliedTotal":168.4,"externalId":"2022","id":"002022","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":42.0,"24":232.0,"25":3.0,"27":42.0,"28":19.0,"29":7.0,"30":6.0,"31":2.0,"33":2.0,"39":5.52380952,"40":17.84615385,"41":56.0,"42":632.0,"43":2.0,"45":1.0,"46":1.0,"47":120.0,"48":58.0,"49":26.0,"50":17.0,"51":6.0,"52":1.0,"53":56.0,"54":7.0,"56":1.0,"58":94.0,"59":493.0,"60":11.28571429,"61":48.61538462,"66":3.0,"68":3.0,"70":2.0,"72":2.0,"73":2.0,"108":1.0,"109":1.0,"155":9.0,"156":4.0,"158":30.0,"179":1.0,"180":1.0,"182":1.0,"183":1.0,"210":13.0,"212":8.0,"213":24.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":37,"totalRanking":91,"totalRating":168.4}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1690700400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":4429795,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":2,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":22,"published":false,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":23,"published":false,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[25,2,3,23,7,20,21],"firstName":"Jahmyr","fullName":"Jahmyr Gibbs","id":4429795,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"26","lastName":"Gibbs","lastNewsDate":1686348048000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":20.646706586826348,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.38605922737149356,"averageDraftPosition":41.912595005428884,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":-0.8442071154642292,"date":1690549515637,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.6145660447020163,"percentOwned":95.00659670950887,"percentStarted":73.23396038479349},"proTeamId":8,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":10,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":12,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":17.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":16.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2}]},"seasonOutlook":"Gibbs was selected with the 12th pick of April's draft.

Gibbs' tackle-breaking, elusiveness and YAC numbers were solid-to-good in 31 collegiate games, but he mixed in a ton of negative runs (rookie-class-high 24%). He made up for that with a 104-1,217-8 receiving line (which included elite efficiency) during the span.

Olave was heavily utilized as a vertical target (his 14.2 aDOT ranked sixth in the league) and extremely efficient (his 2.5 YPRR ranked seventh and his 0.34 fantasy points per snap ranked sixth). Olave finished top 20 among WRs in targets and yards despite finishing 69th in snaps and 49th in routes, so there is still plenty of room for growth for the 23-year-old. With Derek Carr now under center, Olave is positioned for a leap forward in 2023. He's safest as a WR2, but there's upside for more.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":15.0,"externalId":"401437956","id":"01401437956","proTeamId":18,"scoringPeriodId":18,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":5.0,"42":60.0,"43":1.0,"47":12.0,"48":6.0,"49":3.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":5.0,"54":1.0,"58":12.0,"59":28.0,"60":12.0,"61":60.0,"67":1.0,"68":1.0,"71":1.0,"72":1.0,"73":1.0,"156":1.0,"158":6.0,"185":1.0,"210":1.0,"213":2.0}},{"appliedTotal":8.2,"externalId":"401437940","id":"01401437940","proTeamId":18,"scoringPeriodId":17,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":4.0,"42":42.0,"47":8.0,"48":4.0,"49":2.0,"50":1.0,"53":4.0,"58":5.0,"59":5.0,"60":10.5,"61":42.0,"155":1.0,"210":1.0,"213":2.0}},{"appliedAverage":14.2543660684,"appliedTotal":213.815491026,"externalId":"2023","id":"102023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"42":1084.581136,"43":5.399465333,"44":0.292059997,"45":0.295742085,"46":0.193267453,"47":216.0,"48":108.0,"49":54.0,"50":43.0,"51":21.0,"53":73.99488148,"54":14.0,"55":7.0,"56":3.079954401,"57":0.095256322,"58":120.6339337,"60":14.65751568,"61":71.74272104,"62":0.292059997,"63":0.00651155,"67":1.47989763,"68":1.47989763,"71":0.828742673,"72":0.828742673,"73":0.828742673,"210":15.11764706,"213":47.83258285}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2023","id":"002023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":13.213333333333333,"appliedTotal":198.2,"externalId":"2022","id":"002022","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":72.0,"42":1042.0,"43":4.0,"44":1.0,"45":1.0,"46":1.0,"47":204.0,"48":100.0,"49":48.0,"50":35.0,"51":15.0,"52":3.0,"53":72.0,"54":8.0,"56":3.0,"58":119.0,"59":210.0,"60":14.47222222,"61":69.46666667,"67":2.0,"68":2.0,"71":2.0,"72":2.0,"73":2.0,"106":1.0,"108":3.0,"109":3.0,"155":6.0,"156":9.0,"158":26.0,"183":1.0,"184":1.0,"185":1.0,"210":15.0,"213":48.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":25,"totalRanking":66,"totalRating":198.2}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1690700400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":4036133,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":4,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":13,"published":false,"rank":54,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":13,"published":false,"rank":54,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[5,6,23,7,20,21],"firstName":"T.J.","fullName":"T.J.

The 2019 first-round pick was a solid producer with the Lions, but really hit his stride after the trade. From Week 9 on, Hockenson averaged 14.1 fantasy PPG, which trailed only Travis Kelce at the position. His 86 targets (9.6 per game, 24% team share) during the span ranked fifth in the entire league. Including the playoffs, Hockenson saw 10-plus targets in five of his 10 full games with the Vikings (he saw 10-plus in seven of 47 games in Detroit). A boost in TDs would be nice (he's yet to clear six in a season), but with only Justin Jefferson certainly ahead of him for targets in an offense that ranks sixth in TDs during the Kirk Cousins era, the 26-year-old has found his way to top-five (perhaps top-three) status at the position.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":2.6,"externalId":"401437950","id":"01401437950","proTeamId":16,"scoringPeriodId":18,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":1.0,"42":16.0,"47":3.0,"48":1.0,"53":1.0,"58":1.0,"59":11.0,"60":16.0,"61":16.0,"155":1.0,"210":1.0,"213":1.0}},{"appliedTotal":12.9,"externalId":"401437945","id":"01401437945","proTeamId":16,"scoringPeriodId":17,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":7.0,"42":59.0,"47":11.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":7.0,"54":1.0,"58":12.0,"59":13.0,"60":8.429,"61":59.0,"156":1.0,"210":1.0,"213":3.0}},{"appliedAverage":12.871068959733332,"appliedTotal":193.066034396,"externalId":"2023","id":"102023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"42":845.7280023,"43":5.635310061,"44":0.290989978,"45":0.160282607,"46":0.104744684,"47":169.0,"48":84.0,"49":42.0,"50":33.0,"51":16.0,"53":74.93504376,"54":14.0,"55":7.0,"56":1.620592375,"57":0.050121414,"58":109.6690444,"60":11.28614811,"61":55.94309743,"62":0.290989978,"63":0.003362161,"67":0.764127573,"68":0.764127573,"71":0.427911441,"72":0.427911441,"73":0.427911441,"210":15.11764706,"213":41.55668478}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2023","id":"002023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":12.670588235294119,"appliedTotal":215.4,"externalId":"2022","id":"002022","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":86.0,"42":914.0,"43":6.0,"44":2.0,"47":175.0,"48":82.0,"49":36.0,"50":29.0,"51":9.0,"52":2.0,"53":86.0,"54":9.0,"55":1.0,"56":2.0,"58":129.0,"59":413.0,"60":10.62790698,"61":53.76470588,"67":1.0,"68":1.0,"71":1.0,"72":1.0,"73":1.0,"155":8.0,"156":9.0,"158":40.0,"183":3.0,"184":2.0,"186":1.0,"210":17.0,"213":42.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":2,"totalRanking":55,"totalRating":215.4}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1690700400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":15818,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":17,"published":false,"rank":50,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":20,"published":false,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[3,4,5,23,7,20,21],"firstName":"Keenan","fullName":"Keenan Allen","id":15818,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"13","lastName":"Allen","lastNewsDate":1678381663000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":16.131736526946106,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.014647919351169492,"averageDraftPosition":46.57198558807561,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.04720297675257257,"date":1690549504476,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":-0.042005467627177495,"percentOwned":98.09617837733937,"percentStarted":82.78260261764552},"proTeamId":24,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":18.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":12,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":15.625,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":10,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}]},"seasonOutlook":"Allen is entering his 11th NFL season after an up-and-down 2022 campaign in which he missed seven early-season games due to injury but produced elite numbers once back on the field.

Pierce was promoted into a feature role in Week 2 of his rookie campaign and was fantasy's No. 14 RB prior to missing the final four games of the season with an ankle injury. The 2022 fourth-round pick had trouble finding the end zone (five TDs on 250 touches) and with receiving efficiency (4.1 yards per target), though neither is a shock considering the team's QB woes. Pierce may see a reduction from the 16.9 carries and 3.1 targets per game he saw last season with Singletary in the mix, but the 23-year-old looks the part of a lead back and is primed for a step forward in 2023. He's in the RB2 mix.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"401437953","id":"01401437953","proTeamId":34,"scoringPeriodId":18,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"401437936","id":"01401437936","proTeamId":34,"scoringPeriodId":17,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":14.49487322857143,"appliedTotal":202.9282252,"externalId":"2023","id":"102023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":223.9318917,"24":954.1795397,"25":6.421832166,"26":0.262630448,"27":190.0,"28":95.0,"29":47.0,"30":38.0,"31":19.0,"33":44.0,"34":22.0,"35":0.460823072,"36":0.322576151,"37":2.356951803,"38":0.080433722,"39":4.261025673,"40":67.30727043,"42":270.9471384,"43":1.124013188,"44":0.063929496,"45":0.038946537,"46":0.025451562,"47":54.0,"48":27.0,"49":13.0,"50":10.0,"51":5.0,"53":37.46553122,"54":7.0,"55":3.0,"56":0.107273378,"57":0.003317733,"58":50.28244315,"60":7.231904355,"61":19.11245374,"62":0.326559944,"63":0.014208413,"66":2.766352569,"67":0.462832104,"68":3.229184673,"70":1.272522182,"71":0.259185978,"72":1.53170816,"73":1.53170816,"210":14.17647059,"212":52.68223158,"213":15.32120574}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2023","id":"002023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":12.8,"appliedTotal":166.4,"externalId":"2022","id":"002022","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":220.0,"24":939.0,"25":4.0,"27":181.0,"28":87.0,"29":39.0,"30":31.0,"31":11.0,"32":2.0,"33":41.0,"34":17.0,"35":1.0,"36":1.0,"37":2.0,"39":4.26818182,"40":72.23076923,"41":30.0,"42":165.0,"43":1.0,"47":28.0,"48":10.0,"49":4.0,"50":2.0,"53":30.0,"54":1.0,"58":39.0,"59":197.0,"60":5.5,"61":12.69230769,"66":4.0,"68":4.0,"70":2.0,"72":2.0,"73":2.0,"108":1.0,"109":1.0,"155":1.0,"156":11.0,"158":30.0,"179":3.0,"183":1.0,"210":13.0,"212":53.0,"213":7.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":27,"totalRanking":97,"totalRating":166.4}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1690700400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":2976499,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":21,"published":false,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":21,"published":false,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[3,4,5,23,7,20,21],"firstName":"Amari","fullName":"Amari Cooper","id":2976499,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"QUESTIONABLE","jersey":"2","lastName":"Cooper","lastNewsDate":1690558230000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":16.767664670658682,"auctionValueAverageChange":-0.389064460516785,"averageDraftPosition":48.6106312620305,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":-3.4130131291069503,"date":1690549519571,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":-0.02965293446372641,"percentOwned":97.05995421741486,"percentStarted":76.55826795044297},"proTeamId":5,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":18.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":12,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":18.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":10,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}]},"seasonOutlook":"Cooper was traded to the Browns last offseason and proceeded to put together one of his best NFL campaigns.

Kittle has some durability concerns, having completed one full regular season (2018) in six tries.

is entering his first full season as the Seahawks' lead back. The 2022 second-round pick took over as the team's lead back in Week 6 last season and went on to handle 80% of the team's carries (19.7 per game) and 8% of the targets (2.5 per game) during 11 full games. Walker was fantasy's No. 8 RB in points per game (17.1) during 10 regular-season weeks atop the depth chart, though his 21-151-0 receiving line during the span exacerbates the concerns raised prior to last year's draft related to his lack of passing-game involvement. The 22-year-old looks the part as a rusher, but especially with second-round rookie Zach Charbonnet now in the mix, Walker could max out at Nick Chubb-like usage, which would limit his ceiling. He's safest as a midrange

was traded to the Giants after emerging as one of the league's top receiving tight ends during five seasons with the Raiders. Waller's 2019 breakout led to back-to-back top-three fantasy campaigns, but injuries derailed his output the past two seasons. He missed 14 games during the span, but was still fairly effective when on the field, ranking top 10 in fantasy PPG both seasons. Even with the injuries, Waller has seen eight-plus end zone targets in three straight seasons. The 31-year-old is joining a New York offense that has an NFL-low 44 pass TDs over the past three seasons (17 in 2022), but he very well could lead the team in targets considering the question marks at wide receiver. Waller is primed for a rebound and is a top-five fantasy tight end.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":5.5,"externalId":"401437961","id":"01401437961","proTeamId":13,"scoringPeriodId":18,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":2.0,"42":35.0,"47":7.0,"48":3.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":2.0,"58":6.0,"59":13.0,"60":17.5,"61":35.0,"156":1.0,"210":1.0,"213":2.0}},{"appliedTotal":16.2,"externalId":"401437943","id":"01401437943","proTeamId":13,"scoringPeriodId":17,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":3.0,"42":72.0,"43":1.0,"47":14.0,"48":7.0,"49":3.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":3.0,"58":5.0,"59":8.0,"60":24.0,"61":72.0,"156":1.0,"158":6.0,"185":1.0,"210":1.0,"213":3.0}},{"appliedAverage":12.399180264533335,"appliedTotal":185.98770396800003,"externalId":"2023","id":"102023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"42":813.0472372,"43":6.261903992,"44":0.362474879,"45":0.19839423,"46":0.12965063,"47":162.0,"48":81.0,"49":40.0,"50":32.0,"51":16.0,"53":67.2047148,"54":13.0,"55":6.0,"56":1.457662149,"57":0.045082335,"58":100.2119254,"60":12.09806841,"61":53.78133476,"62":0.362474879,"63":0.003291584,"67":0.74808729,"68":0.74808729,"71":0.418928883,"72":0.418928883,"73":0.418928883,"210":15.11764706,"213":39.14970461}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2023","id":"002023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":9.422222222222224,"appliedTotal":84.80000000000001,"externalId":"2022","id":"002022","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":28.0,"42":388.0,"43":3.0,"47":74.0,"48":35.0,"49":15.0,"50":11.0,"51":4.0,"53":28.0,"54":1.0,"58":43.0,"59":80.0,"60":13.85714286,"61":43.11111111,"155":2.0,"156":7.0,"158":18.0,"183":1.0,"185":2.0,"210":9.0,"213":19.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":31,"totalRanking":260,"totalRating":84.8}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1690700400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":4362887,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":8,"published":false,"rank":68,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":8,"published":false,"rank":68,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[0,7,20,21],"firstName":"Justin","fullName":"Justin Fields","id":4362887,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"1","lastName":"Fields","lastNewsDate":1683511306000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":10.45748502994012,"auctionValueAverageChange":-1.3040141182711231,"averageDraftPosition":53.19171726146404,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":-0.3044420194170172,"date":1690549513236,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.006131184706205772,"percentOwned":96.40715946234117,"percentStarted":82.7795354040307},"proTeamId":3,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":10,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":12,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":6.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":6.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":10,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}]},"seasonOutlook":"Fields is entering his third NFL season after an up-and-down 2022 campaign that included some major highs (top-seven fantasy scorer in eight straight games) and some concerning lows (60% completion rate, as well as an NFL-high 55 sacks and 16 fumbles in 15 games).

is atop the depth chart in Tampa Bay following the offseason release of Leonard Fournette.

The 2022 third-round pick produced 64 yards on 14 carries and caught all nine of his targets for 45 yards. White ended up 11th among RBs in receptions as a rookie and, with only Chase Edmonds as serious competition for touches, the second-year back is well positioned for a much larger role. Even in an offense that may struggle without Tom Brady, White is one of the top RB breakout candidates in fantasy this season.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":1.5,"externalId":"401437948","id":"01401437948","proTeamId":27,"scoringPeriodId":18,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":4.0,"24":15.0,"27":3.0,"28":1.0,"39":3.75,"40":15.0,"156":1.0,"210":1.0,"212":1.0}},{"appliedTotal":9.8,"externalId":"401437941","id":"01401437941","proTeamId":27,"scoringPeriodId":17,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":11.0,"24":22.0,"27":4.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"39":2.0,"40":22.0,"41":5.0,"42":26.0,"47":5.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":5.0,"54":1.0,"58":5.0,"59":22.0,"60":5.2,"61":26.0,"155":1.0,"210":1.0,"212":1.0,"213":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":14.474109743000001,"appliedTotal":202.63753640200002,"externalId":"2023","id":"102023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":217.179054,"24":909.0153864,"25":5.504543632,"26":0.236616084,"27":181.0,"28":90.0,"29":45.0,"30":36.0,"31":18.0,"33":43.0,"34":21.0,"35":0.445527761,"36":0.311869433,"37":2.144055426,"38":0.073168386,"39":4.185557354,"40":64.1214173,"42":294.1980171,"43":1.238399787,"44":0.068082854,"45":0.036054552,"46":0.02356165,"47":58.0,"48":29.0,"49":14.0,"50":11.0,"51":5.0,"53":44.21847038,"54":8.0,"55":4.0,"56":0.122018015,"57":0.003773753,"58":56.66170453,"60":6.653283449,"61":20.75255723,"62":0.304698938,"63":0.01408735,"66":2.660070135,"67":0.541600262,"68":3.201670397,"70":1.223632262,"71":0.303296147,"72":1.526928409,"73":1.526928409,"210":14.17647059,"212":50.06315278,"213":17.54836577}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2023","id":"002023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":8.18235294117647,"appliedTotal":139.1,"externalId":"2022","id":"002022","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":129.0,"24":481.0,"25":1.0,"27":89.0,"28":40.0,"29":16.0,"30":12.0,"31":4.0,"32":1.0,"33":18.0,"34":6.0,"37":1.0,"39":3.72868217,"40":28.29411765,"41":50.0,"42":290.0,"43":2.0,"47":54.0,"48":23.0,"49":10.0,"50":6.0,"51":1.0,"53":50.0,"54":5.0,"58":58.0,"59":319.0,"60":5.8,"61":17.05882353,"66":1.0,"67":1.0,"68":3.0,"70":1.0,"71":1.0,"72":3.0,"73":3.0,"107":2.0,"108":4.0,"109":6.0,"114":244.0,"116":22.0,"117":7.0,"155":8.0,"156":9.0,"158":18.0,"179":1.0,"183":2.0,"210":17.0,"212":27.0,"213":13.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":36,"totalRanking":138,"totalRating":139.1}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1690700400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":15795,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":10,"published":false,"rank":61,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":13,"published":false,"rank":55,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[3,4,5,23,7,20,21],"firstName":"DeAndre","fullName":"DeAndre

signed with the Titans in July after he was released by the Cardinals earlier in the offseason. The veteran receiver has struggled to stay on the field of late, totaling 15 missed games over the past two seasons. After a step back in usage and production in 2021, Hopkins did enjoy a nice rebound last season. He soaked up a healthy 29% target share (sixth-highest at WR) and was ninth at WR in fantasy PPG during his nine games. Hopkins is past his prime at age 31, but after the strong showing last season, it's possible he has one more big season in the tank. Tennessee operates a run-heavy scheme, which will limit Hopkins' ceiling, but he's positioned for a big target share and remains in the WR2 mix.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"401437962","id":"01401437962","proTeamId":22,"scoringPeriodId":18,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"401437933","id":"01401437933","proTeamId":22,"scoringPeriodId":17,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":13.63290018,"appliedTotal":204.4935027,"externalId":"2023","id":"102023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"42":988.8057991,"43":3.513839702,"44":0.205980188,"45":0.177663908,"46":0.116103364,"47":197.0,"48":98.0,"49":49.0,"50":39.0,"51":19.0,"53":85.99889197,"54":17.0,"55":8.0,"56":2.463940822,"57":0.076204355,"58":125.3948683,"60":11.49788999,"61":65.40738749,"62":0.205980188,"63":0.007567902,"67":1.719977839,"68":1.719977839,"71":0.96318759,"72":0.96318759,"73":0.96318759,"210":15.11764706,"213":47.15652279}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2023","id":"002023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":16.855555555555554,"appliedTotal":151.7,"externalId":"2022","id":"002022","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":64.0,"42":717.0,"43":3.0,"47":139.0,"48":67.0,"49":31.0,"50":25.0,"51":10.0,"52":2.0,"53":64.0,"54":9.0,"55":3.0,"56":2.0,"58":96.0,"59":165.0,"60":11.203125,"61":79.66666667,"67":2.0,"68":2.0,"71":1.0,"72":1.0,"73":1.0,"108":2.0,"109":2.0,"155":2.0,"156":7.0,"158":18.0,"183":1.0,"185":1.0,"186":1.0,"210":9.0,"213":35.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":47,"totalRanking":120,"totalRating":151.7}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1690700400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":4038941,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":8,"published":false,"rank":70,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":8,"published":false,"rank":70,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[0,7,20,21],"firstName":"Justin","fullName":"Justin Herbert","id":4038941,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"10","lastName":"Herbert","lastNewsDate":1690326110000,"lastVideoDate":1689791969000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":9.44071856287425,"auctionValueAverageChange":-0.7654143161717464,"averageDraftPosition":55.905321354526606,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.9635122093277033,"date":1690549517289,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.07535380606358899,"percentOwned":95.33834980729398,"percentStarted":74.72973091074347},"proTeamId":24,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":10,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":11,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":12,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":7.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":7.125,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}]},"seasonOutlook":"Herbert is entering his fourth NFL season after an odd 2022 campaign in which he finished second in pass attempts, completions and yards for the second consecutive season but saw his fantasy finish tumble from second to 11th. The culprits were a big drop in pass TDs (from 38 to 25) and rushing output (from 302 yards and three TDs to 147 yards and zero TDs). The latter (or perhaps both) may have been related to rib and labrum injuries, so a rebound in 2023 is certainly a possibility. That's especially the case with a new playcaller in Kellen Moore and with a good supporting cast led by Keenan Allen, Mike Williams and Austin Ekeler. Herbert, who ranked fifth with eight top-10 fantasy outings last season, remains a solid fantasy starter with upside.","stats":[{"appliedTotal":18.82,"externalId":"401437960","id":"01401437960","proTeamId":24,"scoringPeriodId":18,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":37.0,"1":25.0,"2":12.0,"3":273.0,"4":2.0,"5":54.0,"6":27.0,"7":13.0,"8":10.0,"9":5.0,"10":2.0,"11":5.0,"12":2.0,"13":2.0,"14":1.0,"21":67.57,"22":273.0,"23":2.0,"24":-1.0,"39":-0.5,"40":-1.0,"64":1.0,"66":1.0,"68":1.0,"156":1.0,"158":12.0,"175":1.0,"176":1.0,"210":1.0,"211":14.0}},{"appliedTotal":16.68,"externalId":"401437946","id":"01401437946","proTeamId":24,"scoringPeriodId":17,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":28.0,"1":21.0,"2":7.0,"3":212.0,"4":2.0,"5":42.0,"6":21.0,"7":10.0,"8":8.0,"9":4.0,"10":2.0,"11":4.0,"12":2.0,"13":1.0,"21":75.0,"22":212.0,"23":1.0,"24":2.0,"39":2.0,"40":2.0,"155":1.0,"158":12.0,"175":2.0,"210":1.0,"211":12.0,"212":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":18.466647756125003,"appliedTotal":295.46636409800004,"externalId":"2023","id":"102023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":604.8505312,"1":404.020295,"2":200.8302362,"3":4318.454874,"4":30.24481168,"5":863.0,"6":431.0,"7":215.0,"8":172.0,"9":86.0,"10":43.0,"11":80.0,"12":40.0,"15":3.884429226,"16":2.538474499,"17":4.821072205,"18":0.651200445,"19":1.545832101,"20":11.35310664,"21":0.667967166,"22":269.9034296,"23":60.29511539,"24":201.7360456,"25":1.411949965,"26":0.06426981,"27":40.0,"28":20.0,"29":10.0,"30":8.0,"31":4.0,"33":12.0,"34":6.0,"35":0.114430927,"36":0.080101649,"37":0.110663266,"38":0.003776513,"39":3.345810756,"40":12.60850285,"62":1.610101911,"63":0.035053889,"64":35.46005145,"65":7.281159421,"66":0.68563344,"68":7.966792861,"69":3.494956522,"70":0.315391382,"72":3.810347904,"73":15.16345454,"210":16.0,"211":215.609236,"212":13.47752201}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2023","id":"002023","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2023,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":16.54470588235294,"appliedTotal":281.26,"externalId":"2022","id":"002022","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2022,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":699.0,"1":477.0,"2":222.0,"3":4739.0,"4":25.0,"5":941.0,"6":466.0,"7":227.0,"8":180.0,"9":84.0,"10":38.0,"11":89.0,"12":40.0,"13":37.0,"14":15.0,"15":1.0,"16":1.0,"17":5.0,"19":1.0,"20":10.0,"21":0.68240343,"22":278.76470588,"23":54.0,"24":147.0,"27":24.0,"28":9.0,"29":3.0,"30":1.0,"33":5.0,"39":2.72222222,"40":8.64705882,"41":2.0,"42":-10.0,"53":2.0,"58":2.0,"59":5.0,"60":-5.0,"61":-0.58823529,"64":38.0,"65":5.0,"66":3.0,"68":8.0,"69":3.0,"72":3.0,"73":13.0,"108":1.0,"109":1.0,"155":10.0,"156":7.0,"158":150.0,"175":11.0,"176":9.0,"177":1.0,"178":3.0,"210":17.0,"211":227.0,"212":17.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":11,"totalRanking":24,"totalRating":281.26}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1690700400000}]}
