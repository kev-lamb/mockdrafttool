# mockdrafttool
This is a WIP, but eventually I hope to make this into a largely customizable tool to allow users to execute mock fantasy football drafts. Users should be able to utilize ADP from multiple sources, choose from a bunch of different draft strategies for bots, different league sizes, scoring, settings, etc.

Can access ADP from ESPN standard format drafts and some pretty basic draft strategies are implemented. Can't draft alongside the bots yet. The draft strategies are set up in a pretty generalizable way so it should be easy to implement and configure more complex strategies as I work on this.
